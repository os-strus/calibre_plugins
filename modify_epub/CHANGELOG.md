# Modify ePub Change Log

## [1.8.5] - 2024-09-29
### Changed

## [1.6.3] - 2021-07-27

## [1.6.2] - 2020-12-18
### Fixed

## [1.6.1] - 2020-10-05
### Fixed

## [1.6.0] - 2020-09-30
### Changed
- Make plugin compatible with calibre 5 (Python 3).  (@chaley)

## [1.4.0] - 2019-10-17
### Added
- Added option to only remove pagemaps and related artifacts generated by Google Play, leaving pagemaps from other sources intact. (Note that removing all pagemaps will override this option.)
- Incorporated Terisa de morgan's option to move metadata jackets to the end of the book.
### Changed
- Minor adjustments to the "unpretty" option, including consideration of EPUB3 elements (section/nav) and removal of EMPTY "display: none" elements.
- Incorporated JimmXinu's fix to the list-based file removal logic.
### Fixed
- Expanded .xpgt link removal for better detection.
- Resequenced modules so that deep parsing would not undo "unpretty" function's work.
- Enhanced pagemap removal function to work regardless of the filename.
- Note: Neither pagemap removal routine affects pagelists incorporated into NCX files.

## [1.3.14] - 2017-11-29
### Added
- Added option to remove page-map.xml files.

## [1.3.13] - 2015-07-05
### Added
- Added option to disable the confirmation prompt each time to update the epub. Use at your own risk - if you make simultaneous other changes to the book record they may get lost.
### Fixed
- Cancel on the progress dialog

## [1.3.12] - 2014-10-02
### Changed
- Enhancement to "stripkobo", "stripspans", and "unpretty" options: All three now remove `</br>` and `</hr>` tags and always make BR and HR self-closing elements. (This fixes invalid `</br>` and `</hr>` markup, if such is present.)
- Moved "stripkobo", "stripspans", and "unpretty" into the "Known artifacts" category to balance the dialog box better.
- Added some code to dialogs.py to make the dialog box scrollable on smaller screens.
- Help file filled in how one can detect the need to smarten punctuation (was previously blank.)
### Fixed
- Minor bug in "stripkobo" option that missed some Kobo artifacts inside the HEAD element.
- Minor spacing bugs in "unpretty" option.

## [1.3.11] - 2014-08-13
### Added
- Add an "unpretty" option to de-indent and otherwise reformat HTML elements in markup. This should have no effect on the rendered content; it only cleans the source code up a bit.
- Add a "stripspans" option to allow removal of attributeless `<span>` elements from markup, as well as normalizing empty `<x></x>` elements to the `<x/>` form.
- Add a "stripkobo" option to allow removal of the Kobo-specific code from kepub books, transforming them into standard EPUB books. This does NOT remove Kobo's DRM.
- Note: Both of the above will also completely remove `<a>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<big>`, `<small>`, `<em>`, `<span>`, and `<strong>` elements from the markup when those elements have neither attributes nor content.
### Fixed
- "Remove Adobe resource DRM meta tags" option to remove leading spaces and/or newlines, so these meta tags are completely removed instead of leaving blank lines.

## [1.3.10] - 2014-07-28
### Changed
- For Calibre 2.0 compliance.

## [1.3.9] - 2013-09-01

### Added
- Add a "Append extra CSS" option to allow appending any css style information from Preferences->Common Options->Look & Feel->Extra CSS to each .css file in the ePub.
### Changed
- Respect the tweak "save_original_format_when_polishing" if set to make a .ORIGINAL_EPUB copy of the book before making modifications if no such copy exists.
- After running Modify ePub ensure the book details panel is updated in case an ORIGINAL_EPUB was added
### Fixed
- Encrypted font ePubs being treated as DRM protected preventing Font removal

## [1.3.7] - 2013-02-15
### Fixed
- Dependency on calibre code removed in 0.9.19

## [1.3.6] - 2012-12-09

## [1.3.5] - 2012-11-22
### Added

### Changed
- Change to ensure when running via command line the lack of an opf file allows plugin to still run.

## [1.3.4] - 2012-11-16
### Fixed
- For calibre "bug" to ensure that if user has both remove javascript and smarten punctuation checked, that remove javascript runs first which ensures smarten punctuation will actually work correctly for quotes.

## [1.3.3] - 2012-11-08
### Fixed
- For when Update metadata is "not" selected

## [1.3.2] - 2012-11-08
